#  Cloud-Powered Educational Data Mining: GPA Prediction

This project analyzes student performance data and builds a **machine learning model** to predict **GPA (Grade Point Average)** based on study-related factors. It was developed as part of the *Foundation of Data Science* subject and implemented using **Google Colab**.


---

##  Features
- Load and explore **student dataset**
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
  - Correlation heatmap  
  - Distribution plots  
  - Scatter plots for study time & absences vs GPA  
- Build and train a **Linear Regression model**
- Evaluate model with **R² Score & Mean Squared Error**
- Predict GPA for new students
- Visualize **Actual vs Predicted GPA**

---

## Results
- **R² Score:** ~0.95 (very high accuracy )  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~0.03 (very low error )  
- Example student prediction → Predicted GPA ≈ **3.27**

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Google Colab** (cloud-based environment)  
- **GitHub** (version control & hosting)

---

##  Sample Visualizations
- **Correlation Heatmap**
- **Study Time vs GPA**
- **Absences vs GPA**
- **Actual vs Predicted GPA**
